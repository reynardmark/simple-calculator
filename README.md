# Simple Calculator

## Description
A simple calculator where features are inspired from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) and this [app idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md).

This simple application is for the sake of recalling HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, and basic TS.

## Setup

```
$ git clone git@github.com:reynardmark/simple-calculator.git
$ cd simple-calculator
$ yarn
```

### Starting the app

```
